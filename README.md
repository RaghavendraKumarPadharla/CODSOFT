## Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features. The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

## Project Overview
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any missing or outlier values.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implement and train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict survival.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have developed a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a Titanic passenger's survival based on various features such as age, gender, and ticket class. Through data exploration, preprocessing, and model training, we aimed to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.
